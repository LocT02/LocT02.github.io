    <h1> Audio Experiences</h1>
    <h2> Welcome to my audio section! I'm also a self-taught musician and composer that first got into music by following synthesia tutorials
      on Youtube, then got into playing anime songs by ear, and then transcribing and writing scores on Musescore3 and Musescore4. I briefly used FL Studio for midi recording and
      a bit of electronics composition, but decided to stick to score writing as a hobby. My piano arrangements can be found on

          <em class="description">Composed in Musescore3 using built-in synthesizers for the first time. Designed to provoke an RPG tavern setting during design phase of Cybershift. Of course the outcome was changed
            during prototype with the shift to a more sci-fi theme. This piece still serves as one of my greatest experimental piece that I eventually 
            want to use and improve in future games.

          <em class="description">A track in honor of the story of my first visual novel, Beyond the Reflection. When I first wrote this piece, a big part of the
            score was following the concept of <i>change</i>, where I had the piano be the representative of the protagonist's heartbeat and the strings act in part of
            their feelings in combat with unexpectancy, or life changing moments. The pick-up of arpeggiated notes were meant to escalates the situation around the protagonist.
